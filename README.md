Statistical Rethinking Notebooks
================================

These notebooks contain the R code written by Richard McElreath,
available for download on his website xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethnking
in the file code.txt

I broke each chapter into a separate Jupyter notebook, and devoted
one cell to each code fragment.

Requirements
------------

You will need Richard's R package rethinking installed. Installation
instructions and source are available on his GitHub repository:

https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking

As with the book, you will need to have RStan installed. McElreath's rethinking
repository gives instructions for installing it. You will also need
to have Jupyter's R kernel installed, along with, of course, Jupyter
Notebook and R.
